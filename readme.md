# SINS — SINS Is Not SFML

SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network. It is written in C++, and has bindings for various languages such as C, .Net, Ruby, Python.

**SINS is NOT SFML! And for complete clarity, it's not an attempt to undermine SFML in anyway. SFML is a fantastic library, you should use it.**
